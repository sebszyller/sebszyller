## Hello there

My name is Sebastian and I'm a doctoral researcher in
[Secure Systems Group](https://ssg.aalto.fi) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en).

I work on ownership and confidentiality in machine learning. You can get a better idea by looking at my [publication list](https://sebszyller.com/publications) ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wuwZNVYAAAAJ&hl=en)) or [blog posts](https://sebszyller.com/blog).

Here you can find both some personal repos as well as forks of the official releases of my scientific work ([PRADA defence](https://github.com/sebszyller/prada-protecting-against-dnn-model-stealing-attacks), [DAWN watermarking](https://github.com/sebszyller/dawn-dynamic-adversarial-watermarking-of-neural-networks) and [clustering for fraud detection](https://github.com/sebszyller/recagglo)).
