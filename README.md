## Hello there

My name is Sebastian and I'm a research scientist at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html).

I work on security and privacy of machine learning.
You can get a better idea by looking at my [publication list](https://sebszyller.com/publications) ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wuwZNVYAAAAJ&hl=en)) or [blog posts](https://sebszyller.com/blog).

Here you can find both some personal repos as well as forks of the official releases of my scientific work:
- [conflicts in ML protection mechanisms](https://github.com/ssg-research/conflicts-in-ml-protection-mechanisms)
- [DAWN watermarking](https://github.com/ssg-research/dawn-dynamic-adversarial-watermarking-of-neural-networks)
- [clustering for fraud detection](https://github.com/SSGAalto/recagglo)
- [PRADA defence](https://github.com/SSGAalto/prada-protecting-against-dnn-model-stealing-attacks)

(I use neovim, btw)
