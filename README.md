### Hello there

My name is Sebastian and I'm a doctoral researcher in
[Secure Systems Group](https://ssg.aalto.fi) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en).

I specialise in security and privacy of machine learning.

Here you can find both some personal repos as well as forks of the official releases of my scientific work ([this](https://github.com/sebszyller/prada-protecting-against-dnn-model-stealing-attacks) and [that](https://github.com/sebszyller/recagglo)).
